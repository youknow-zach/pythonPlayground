Python class 2 has been on Functions, Files, and Dictionaries.
Total topics covered include:

-Files and CSV reading
-Dictionaries and accumulation
-Functions and tuples (including implied packing and unpacking)
-Anonymous sorting with lambdas
-Keyword parameters
-Iteration and advanced Functions
-While loops
-Sorting
-Passing functions and lambdas as sorting keys

I will be creating a program to test all of these topics. The program should:
#Import a CSV
      -It will prompt the user for a program name, but link to one by default
#parse the csv
#display the cleaned data to the user
#prompt the user for displaying certain sorting of the data, such as:
      -The names of users in alpha order
      -The names of users sorted by a particular attribute
#The program will be able to save the sorted data to a CSV file that the user
  can successfully import to and view in Google Sheets
