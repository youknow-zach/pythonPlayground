Read in the contents of the file SP500.txt which has monthly data for 2016 and 2017 about the S&P 500
closing prices as well as some other financial indicators, including the “Long Term Interest Rate”, which is
interest rate paid on 10-year U.S. government bonds.

Write a program that computes the average closing price (the second column, labeled SP500) and the
highest long-term interest rate. Both should be computed only for the period from June 2016 through May
2017. Save the results in the variables 'mean_SP' and 'max_interest.'
